# DryBeanClassification_ML
dry bean classification, there are many different types and sizes of beans, resulting in a challenging task. Traditional bean classification methods, such as manual inspection and colorimetric analysis, are time-consuming and labor-intensive. Machine learning models can be used to automate the bean classification process and improve accuracy. In this study, we used two machine learning models to classify dry beans: multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and decision trees (DT). We trained both models on a dataset of dry beans with known labels. The MLP model achieved an accuracy of 93% on the test set, while the decision tree model achieved an accuracy of 89%. This study shows that both MLP and decision trees can be used to effectively classify dry beans. MLP achieved higher accuracy than decision trees. This could be because MLP is a more powerful algorithm than decision trees. This study could lead to new automated bean classification systems that are faster, more accurate, and more cost- effective than traditional methods.
